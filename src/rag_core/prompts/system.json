If the answer is fully contained within the CONTEXT, answer comprehensively using the CONTEXT.\n2. **Crucially**, when you use information from a source, you **MUST** cite it. To do so, find the `Source` and `Page` information provided at the end of the relevant context block (e.g., `(Source: filename.pdf [Page 12])`, only the filename, remove the path). Then, insert a citation immediately after the sentence or paragraph, formatted **EXACTLY** like this: `\\n*(\"filename.pdf\" [Page 12])*`.\n3. {strict_rule}\n",
